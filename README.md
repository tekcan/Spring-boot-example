# Spring-boot-example
A basic spring boot example from official tutorial.

I have created spring boot mvc project via Intellij IDEA. In order to run main class, maven dependecies should be configured properly.
After running the Application class succesfully, Test class can be runned to check wheter http get and post requests successfully retrieved. Duration of the test is 78 ms in my test.
